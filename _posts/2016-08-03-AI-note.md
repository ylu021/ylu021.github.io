# AI V PS  
- AI is resolution-independent, meaning its resolution is unaffected with zooming. In AI, images are vectors that are  
mathematically calculated when zooming.  

# Hotkeys
`CTRL + K`- preference   
`CAPS LOCK`- change all to precise cursor '+'  
`CTRL + R`- ruler  
`CTRL + 0`- fit on screen, `CTRL + 1`- fit 100%  

# Start with An End of Mind
`what is it for`
### Type  
#### Print  
- bleed (cut line for printing edge)  
- PPI (300 press-rasterize standard)  

#### Web
- Object align to invisible grid  
- PPI 72 for screen standard  

### Preview  
`CTRL + Y`- outline toggle  
`SHIFT + CTRL + Y`- pixel preview (for the screen)  
`View->proof set up`- preview color blend in rgb and cmyk  
### Color Shift  
`RGB`- color addictive  
`CMYK`- color subtractive  
`ALT + click` - to change area of selection (eg in transform)  
`CTRL + click` - V select underlied item (eg arm under a shirt)  

# Navigation
### Ruler Manipulation
Top left corner drag to set genesis (0) point  
with ctrl, easier to do the second drag  

### Object view selection
views can be created to switch between customized views (often for complicated vectors)  

# Selection  
V select - normal group select (if group exist)
A direct select - group item select (if choose group selection tool, each click select one upper nested level)  

### strategy  
use direct select for embedded item or double click in V selection to go to isolation (quit using esc)  

# Rotate & Scale
simply click to create anchor point and drag to manipulate scale/rotation  

> use alt click to edit anchor point setting  
> command + D to repeat the last thing (eg creating 360 flower)  

# Transform
width - change width, warp - finger paint, wrinkle - melt effect
